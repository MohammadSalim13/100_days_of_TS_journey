# Day 2 — `any` vs `unknown`

**Theme:** Type safety is about enforcing correctness, not silencing the compiler.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Understand why `unknown` is the correct default for unsafe data and why `any` should be avoided in professional TypeScript codebases.

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

### `any`
- Disables type checking
- Allows unsafe property access
- Propagates silently through the system
- Leads to runtime failures

### `unknown`
- Safest top type
- Requires explicit narrowing
- Prevents unsafe access
- Forces intentional validation

> **Rule:** If data comes from outside your system, start with `unknown`.

## 🔍 Mental Model

| Type | Read | Call | Assign | Safe |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| `any` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `unknown` | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |

`unknown` means: *“I don’t know what this is — prove it first.”*

## ❌ Exercise 1 — Spot the Bug

```ts
function parseUser(data: any) {
  return data.name.toUpperCase();
}
